These are some todo items to get be working in ecl's Common Lisp
repl.

+ figure out how to enable ecl's readline by default.
+ wrap git commands so I run them from lisp repl
+ wrap common Unix commands
	- cd
	- pwd
	- ls
	- mkdir
	- cp
	- mv
	- rm
	- chown
	- chmod
+ write a helpful "find" command rather than wrapping the Unix one
	- looks at cl-fad package to see if it has what I need.
+ figure out how to create a sandbox sub-shell for development
