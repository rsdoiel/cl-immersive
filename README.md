cl-user-shell
==============

A brief exploration of using ecl's Lisp repl as a user shell on a Raspberry Pi.

To install add 

```lisp
	(load "user-shell.lisp")
```

to your .eclrc file (e.g. $HOME/$USERNAME/.eclrc). If you've placed ecl-user-shell
outside your home directory you may need to adjust the path to load user-shell.lisp.
